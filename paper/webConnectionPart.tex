\subsection{Web Connection}

Our application's interface with the internet needs to serve three purposes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Retrieve pseudo random images to use for embedding a message. 
\item Upload images to a public online forum anonymously without altering the image.
\item Retrieve specific images from a public online forum anonymously without altering the image. 
\end{enumerate}

After some research, we discovered a service that could satisfy the first purpose. The Cat API provides random cat images retrieved from Tumblr. The API is reliable and returns content neutral images big enough to store information. A downside to this approach is that statistical steganalysis can be done to compare the uploaded images to the originals. The possibility of using local unique images is out of the scope of our project. The next two requirements are fulfilled by Sendspace.com. This website provides an external API that allows our application to easily interface with and upload and download full size images anonymously. 

%The only significant issue that we encountered while using these online resources was with Sendspace.
% At some point, Sendspace updated their API to require a key. We were not aware of this update and our application was completely broken until we found the bug and fixed it.

The online resources work together as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Cat API retrieves a random cat image for a message to be embedded into.
\item Embed data into image.
\item Upload the encoded image to Sendspace. Sendspace returns and download and delete URL.
\item Download the encoded image using the download URL.
\item Decode the image to restore original data. 
%This allows for the retrieval of the original message. 
\end{enumerate}
