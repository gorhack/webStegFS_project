\begin{abstract}
In 2007 Arati Baliga, Joe Kilian, and Liviu Iftode of Rutgers University presented the idea of a web based covert file system~\cite{Baliga2007}. The purpose of a web based covert file system is providing confidentiality and plausible deniability regarding the existence of files. The key components of a web based covert file system is hiding files within media using steganographic techniques using online file sharing for the purpose of collaboration~\cite{Baliga2007}. We created such a system, covertFS, as a prototype to develop the idea for a web based covert file system previously mentioned. Our prototype of the web based covert file system implements steganographic techniques to obfuscate an entire file system on a public file share site. By storing data in this manner, rather than within the application or on a users computer, we provide confidentiality and plausible deniability to both the users and the companies that manage these public file sharing sites.

\section{Introduction}

%\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} main purpose of a web-based covert filesystem is to attempt to develop an environment that allows uses to store and share information with one another in a more discreet and private manner. Technology continues to advance at a rapid pace, and its advancements are making their way into nearly everything we use and wear. 

\IEEEPARstart{T}{echnology} continues to integrate itself more and more in our daily lives because of the convenience it provides to users. Users are becoming connected to the internet in multiple ways nearly everywhere they go. The Internet of Things keep users engaged and updated on their various interests. Today, a user will typically have at least a cell phone on their person on which they will browse email, social media sites, and use various other applications. These applications themselves, regardless of the convenience they provide users, can track and offer the user the option to post their information on the user's social media site profile to share among friends and acquaintances.

The majority of people interact with multiple forms of technology throughout each day. Some technologies we interact with collect data from our interaction. Also, the widespread use of social media makes it easier to find information about people. Technology, coupled with social media and other applications, can begin to paint a picture used to identify individuals with only non-identifiable information [? Ad platforms, etc]. Sometimes this data collection is used solely to advertise a product to you, but sometimes there are more nefarious means of data collection that lead to black mail, social engineering attacks, or worse. Even if the technology and the application is secure, maybe the service provider itself is not\cite{Baliga2007}.

The means to store and share information in a covert manner not only serves multiple purposes, but also has various implications depending on how those means are used. There will be innovations designed with the good intentions, yet there will also usually be clever modifications of those designs for malicious intentions. (Identify good and bad use cases?)

This project is an application that allows users to share information in a covert manner that can provide plausible deniability to not only the users but also to the file sharing or social media site used to store the information. Plausible deniability is the indetermination that the data exists with certainty and confidentiality is the idea that the hidden data cannot be uncovered\cite{Baliga2007}. Even if the existence of the file system is uncovered, the data should remain protected and confidential. 

\section{Related Works}
There are other projects and systems that have been released which offer users covert methods of sharing information. One such work is StegFS\cite{Tan2003}.  The concept of StegFS is a designing a filesystem that contains protected directories which are hidden through the use encryption and steganography. To the extent that these protected directories would not be located or detected unless a password or access key is provided~cite{Tan2003}. This concept grants users plausible deniability to the existence of any information contained within those protected directories, yet these protected directories are still stored to an extent within the user's machine. All information used within CovertFS will only be stored within RAM, thus it increases the security and plausibile deniability benefits to users.
 In 2007 students and faculty from Rutgers University provided the main concepts and basic outline for the implementation and design of a covert file system\cite{Baliga2007}.  There has been no other implementation of the application described in Rutger's paper, and this project is our take at creating a working prototype which could later be used to develop a successful application or implementation of the covert file system.

%Yet by entering the covert realm of the internet we are allowing our project to criticized on the ethics of it development in accordance with ACM code of Ethics and Professional Conduct\cite{Anderson1993}. Just as Tor is reviewed arguments are brought up against further development\cite{Guitton2013} so to may this project draw vast attention because of what it offers or means to malicious users and intentions.

\section{Design Overview}

In this section we will explain how we decided to implement a prototype of this project.

\subsection{Mapping File System Data to Photos}

How is the data stored in our file system, and how it is constructed.

%\subsection{Steganography the System Uses}

%The steg technique that we used in this covertfs, and how it works. We explain why we decided to use this type of steganography and how this component can be swapped out with an other type of steganography that the user would like to use instead.

%\section{Ethics}

%Is it ethical? Weighing the good vs the bad uses this system provides. What are the ethics of this system when we are storing our system on a social media or file sharing site (like sendspace)? 


\section{Conclusion}

An implementation that would increase the flexibility and security of this project is developing the covertfs into the TAILS operating system and having it run as a bootable program through the a flash drive. The reason for this is because the TAILS operating system in and of itself offers various security measures to ensure a stable and fucntioning system. We are working to develop a working prototype where our covertfs is integrated in the TAILS operating system to further allow confidentality and plausible deniability to the users. 

\subsection{Tails}

Tails will be completed prior to publication. TBD. 
%One of the things we would like to implement into this project is developing the covertfs into the TAILS operating system and having it run as a bootable program through the a flash drive. The reason for this is because the TAILS operating system in and of itself offers various security measures to ensure a stable and functioning system. We would like to develop a working prototype where our covertfs is integrated in the TAILS operating system to further allow confidentiality and plausible deniability to the users. 

\subsection{Future Work}
Our current implementation of covertFS does not require any user authentication, it only requires the 6-character code of the file system image to access all files in the system. We use versioning (i.e. the current version of the file system uses this code, if you change anything then a new code will correspond to the new file system) to protect the information stored in the file system from being deleted--- we don't ever delete images from the online file storage site, even though some sites allow it. An alternative approach could require a user to have an account with the covertFS database. This would take away the idea of plausible deniability, as every user would require some sort of entry in the database. However, it could add to the confidentiality of the file system, as only authenticated users would be able to access the data.
Another possibility would be to add a simple password entry into the encryption suite. This could increase confidentiality, without removing plausible deniability.


\subsection{Encryption and Advanced Steganography Techniques}

Another future implementation worth looking into is the use of a more advanced steganographic technique. The purpose of this is to ensure the confidentiality and plausible deniability of the users by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensuring that pictures being used to hide the information do not give tell-tale signs of modification
\item To increase the difficulty of steganographic tools discovering the encrypted pictures within the sea of publicly shared images within the file sharing site or social media site that the system it using to store the file system.
\end{enumerate}
There are many different kinds of steganographic techniques that assist in reducing the effectiveness of statistical analysis, recovery of data, and other methods of detection. [?] Other implementations of steganography do not use images at all, but rather encode data within other forms of media such as audio files or PDFs. Using a better steganographic technique in addition to encryption would increase confidentiality and plausible deniability [?]. %depending on definition of these in the introduction, need to find a source.
